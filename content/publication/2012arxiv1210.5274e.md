abstract = "The 2012 International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) Mock Data Challenge (MDC) is designed to test current Gravitational Wave (GW) detection algorithms. Here we will briefly outline two detection algorithms for a stochastic background of gravitational waves, namely, a first-order likelihood method and an optimal statistic method and present our results from the closed MDC data sets."
